## Course Work

### Predicting Movie Genre
My first project labeled *Predicting Movie Genre.ipnyb* is a basic application of using Python to download data from a web API, perform data preprocessing, and apply two different classification algorithms. This project was part of my undergraduate course MA 346 - Data Science taught by Professor Noah Giansiracusa and draws from two texts, *Automate The Boring Stuff With Python* by Al Sweigart and *Python Data Science Handbook* by Jake VanderPlas. Purpose of assignment was to strengthen core Python abilities like connecting with API's, data manipulation with Pandas, data visualization with seaborn, and practicing building models with sklearn. Grade was not contingent on performance of the models.

## Personal Projects
### Ideas 
*Data Visualization using Plot.ly's Dash framework - FiveThirtyEight dataset on Aderrall use in the U.S.
*Increase the scope of Movie Genre project by trying to improve accuracy metric with better input data i.e. filter on rating as well as number of ratings for more representative data
*Host portfolio on Django web app
